    <string name="failteInfo">Fáilte Feirste Thiar (Welcome to West Belfast) took the opportunity arising from peace to develop the West Belfast Tourism product, develop the tourism infrastructure; support tourism related business and social enterprises, train local people as tour guides, promote local social and economic regeneration via small business development and job creation.
We market the uniqueness of West Belfast as a tourist attraction, re-branding the area as a place to visit which provides a quality tourist product and customer satisfaction.
Fáilte Feirste Thiar acts as a role model, a leader and living example in what can be achieved when local communities work collaboratively and in partnership with Government departments, tourism promoters and other stakeholders to create employment, opportunities and to contribute to the portrayal of an image of a community - confident, welcoming and vibrant.</string>
